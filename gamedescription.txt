I am making a unity 3d game:  Its a grill or braai timing game where the user needs to turn the grids just at the right moment to get points.

there is the following objects in the game and defined unity:
1. a grid (GameObject 'braaiGrid')
2. a hamburger (GameObject 'hamburger') 
3. the user game score (Text 'scoreText')
4. a gametimer (Text 'timerText')
5. a countdown timer (Text 'xttimershowow')
6. the class name is "BraaiGame"
7. End game text (Text 'endGameText')
8. smoke particle (gamobject 'smoke')

the smoke and end game text is hidden at the start of the game, the rest is shown.

9. 
The screen is clickable any time.
The grid (and burger) should be flipped 180 degrees verticaly and horizontally each time the screen is clicked.
The speed of the flip should be 20ms.

10. The user is shown their gamescore throughout the game.

11. A countdownTimer is shown to the user, and this timer counts down from 5 seconds to 0 seconds.

12. Smoke is shown (enabled) at 0.5 seconds of the countdowntimer, and is shown until the the user clicks.

The user gets 1 point if they click the screen when the countdowntimer reaches between 0.5 seconds and 0.0seconds. 
If the user 

12. A gametimer is shown to the user counting up from 0s to 60s. 
The game is over when the timer reaches 60s. 
The end score should be displayed to them in an awesome style (without more assets being added) when the game ends.
When the game ends only the burger, end game score, and end game text should be visible.

give me the just the code please

The grid needs to be turned every second (almost on the second) or you dont score points.
